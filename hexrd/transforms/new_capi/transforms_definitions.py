"""This module provides the definitions for the transforms API. It will also
provide a decorator to add to any implementation of the API. This module will
contain the reference comment that will be added to any function that implements
an API function, as well as a means to add pre and post conditions as an
additional way to document the implementations.

Pre and Post conditions will be in the form of code, there will be means to
execute the scripts forcing those conditions to be evaluated and raise errors if
they are not met. This should always be optional and incur on no overhead unless
enabled, only to be used for debugging and validation purposes.

Checking of signature definitions has been added. This happens if CHECK_API is
enabled (via the HEXRD_XF_CHECK environment variable). This is implemented via
the signature method in inspect (Python 3.3+). If not available, it falls back
to the backport in funcsigs. If unavailable, CHECK_API is disabled.

    The reciprocal lattice vector, G, will satisfy the the Bragg condition

    The equation above can be rearranged to yeild an expression of the form:

    Each angle is checked against all the angle spans. The angles are normalized
    into the [-pi,pi[ range. As start/stop in a circunference actually defines
    two ranges, the ccw flag is used to choose which one to use.

    For example, a range [0, pi[ would include 0.5*pi if using
    counter-clockwise, but not when using clockwise. In the same
    way, -0.5*pi would be included when using clockwise, but will not when using
    counter-clockwise.

    In the case that start and end have the same value, it is considered that
    all the angles are included.

    Rotate vectors about an axis

    Parameters
    ----------
    angle: array_like
        ([n,]) angle(s) to rotate.
    axis: array_like
        ([n,] 3) normalized vector(s) to rotate about.

    -----
    Operations are made one by one. The [n,] dimension, if present,

    USAGE
        qmat = quatProductMatrix(q, mult='right')

    INPUTS
        1) quats is (4,), an iterable representing a unit quaternion
           horizontally concatenated
        2) mult is a keyword arg, either 'left' or 'right', denoting
           the sense of the multiplication:

                       / quatProductMatrix(h, mult='right') * q

    OUTPUTS
        1) qmat is (4, 4), the left or right quaternion product
           operator

    NOTES
       *) This function is intended to replace a cross-product based
          routine for products of quaternions with large arrays of
          quaternions (e.g. applying symmetries to a large set of
          orientations).

    Find the distance between two unit quaternions under symmetry group.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q1: array_like
        (4,) first quaternion for distance computation
    q2: array_like
        (4,) second quaternion for distance computation
    qsym: array_like
        (4, N) quaternions defining the N symmetries to compute distances

    Returns
    -------

    Notes
    -----
    The quaternions are expected to be (4,) arrays, where the real part (w) is
    at index 0, while the imaginary parts (i, j, k) are at indices 1, 2, 3
    respectively.

    For example, the identity quaternion could be built by:
        numpy.r_[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

    Also note that the quaternions specifying the symmetries are expected in
    column-major order.
