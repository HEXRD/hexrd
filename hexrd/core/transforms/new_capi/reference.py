def intersect_ray_plane(ro, rv, p):
    '''
    ray-plane intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    ro: array[3]
        point of origin of the ray (ray origin).

    rv: array[3]
        direction vector of the ray (ray vector).

    p: array[4]
        (A, B, C, D) coeficients for the plane formula (Ax+By+Cz+D=0).

    Returns
    -------
    t : scalar
        t  where ray intersects with plane, such as (ro + t*rv) lies within p.

    Notes
    -----
    If t is negative, the intersection happens 'behind' the origin point.

    In the case where (A,B,C) -the plane normal- is orthogonal to rv, no
    intersection will happen (or the ray is fully on the plane). In that case,
    t will be non-finite.

    Vector rv needs not to be an unit vector, result will be scaled accordingly
    based on the modulo of rv. However, a 0 vector will result in non-finite
    result.

    The code is based on the segment-plane intersection in  [1]_
