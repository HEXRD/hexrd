"""
this class was put in utils as there isn't any other obvious place where it
belongs. this routine is a generic multiprocessing routine for taking a function
which has to be run over multiple inputs and parallelizes it ove all available cpus.

This is an example script from the Github repo https://github.com/brmather/pycurious
